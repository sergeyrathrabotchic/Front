            The person I admire most of all is Lady Diana Spenser, a former member of the British royal family.
            Diana Francis Spencer, Her Highness the Princess of Wales, was born on 1 July 1961 in Norfolk County to
            an English aristocratic family. She was called the princess of hearts, the people's princess, and a fashion
            icon for all time.
            The future princess's biography was perfect. Diana received her primary education at
            Sandringham. Later the girl attended Sylfield Private School and after that studied at Riddlesworth Hall.
            As a child the character of the future crown princess was not difficult, but she was always determined
            even stubborn sometimes. Diana studied briefly in Switzerland, but returned home due to intense
            homesickness. After finishing her studies, she started working as a nanny and kindergarten teacher in
            the prestigious Knightsbridge area of London.
            Princess Diana was much loved by the people of Britain, who affectionately called her Lady Di.
            Princess Diana was a philanthropist, donating money to various foundations, an activist in the
            movement to ban land mines, providing material and moral help to people. Princess Diana cared for 100
            organizations which she regularly visited. Moreover, Lady Di impressed British citizens with her bravery
            and sincere involvement in the problems of hospitals, orphan asylums and homes for the elderly.
            On 31 August 1997, Diana was killed in a car crash during her visit to Paris. Frankly speaking, I admire
            her because her activism inspired many people, her image and style made her an international icon. To
            my mind, by looking at her photos you can tell how creative and imaginative she was. When I think of
            her, I am sure that we should be kinder and more tolerant to each other.
